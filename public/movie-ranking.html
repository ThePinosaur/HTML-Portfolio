<h1> Claudia's Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies in no particular order</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is a beautifully animated movie with complex and interesting female characters, including the lead.</p>

<h3>Life is Beautiful</h3>
<p>This movie is not just a WWII movie, it is a movie about a parent's love and devotion to their child even in the hardest of times.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Another beautiful movie by Hayao Miyazaki with another strong female lead. This movies could be considered as a fantasy romance film but it is so much more than that because of the rich animation and complexity in characters.</p>

<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>Another movie set during war, the spanish civil war, with another compelx female lead. This story is about a little girl who is trying to prove she belongs in the fantasy world away from reality. Lots of amazing special effects and a captivating story.</p>

<h3>Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio</h3>
<p>I just realized most of my favourite movies are set during war times but do not focus on war. This is the story of pinocchio told by the amazing Guillermo del Toro, which means you will find amazing visuals and a complex and hearfelt story about a parent and their child.</p>
